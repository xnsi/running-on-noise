# Running on Noise

Wait, you are saying your bluetooth speaker will automatically turn off after being idle for few minutes in order to save power? No worries, the white noise maker will periodically play some white noises for you to keep your bluetooth speaker active!

## Attention
This tool is only for Windows system!

## Dependency
Need [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) for playing the noise and creating the Windows tray icon.
